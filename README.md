# Street Fighter Game Project
## Introduction
This Python project is a text-based Street Fighter game that engages two players in a battle using a set of predefined powers. The game allows players to choose their powers, and the battle ensues until one of the players runs out of life points. The project showcases the use of a while loop, conditional statements, and random number generation to simulate the gameplay.

### Project Details
### Players and Powers
#### Player 1: Human player making selections.
#### Player 2: Computer player with randomly generated selections.
#### Powers: Both players have a set of powers, including punches, kicks, special moves, and the ability to block.
## Game Mechanics
#### Players take turns selecting powers.
#### Damage is dealt based on the chosen powers.
#### The game loop continues until one player's life points reach zero.
#### The winner is declared, and the option to play again is provided.
## Power Options
#### 0: Punch
#### 1: Kick
#### 2: Haduken
#### 3: Upper Kick
#### 4: Block
# Bugs Resolved
#### Adjusted the conditional statements to correctly evaluate power selections and calculate damage.
#### Ensured that block actions do not result in damage to the opposing player.
#### Improved the game flow to handle the end of the game and declare a winner.
#### How to Run the Game
